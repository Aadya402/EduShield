**EduShield** is a full-stack web application designed to combat fraud in the student loan sector. By leveraging machine learning and advanced real-time behavioral analysis, our platform provides a secure, efficient, and intelligent solution for processing loan applications, protecting both lenders and genuine applicants.

This project was built for a hackathon to demonstrate a modern, end-to-end approach to AI-driven fraud detection.

## üöÄ Key Features

EduShield is more than just a form. It's an intelligent system with several layers of fraud detection.

* **üß† AI-Powered Risk Scoring:** At its core, a `Random Forest` model trained on various user features predicts the probability of fraud, generating a real-time risk score for each application.

* **üí° Real-time Behavioral Analysis:** The system captures and analyzes how a user interacts with the form, flagging non-human or suspicious behavior. Key metrics include:
    * `Typing Speed`
    * `Error Rate` (corrections made while typing)
    * `Hesitation Time`

* **üì∏ Advanced Liveness Detection:** To prevent spoofing with static photos, EduShield employs a **Flashing Color Liveness Check**. The screen flashes different colors, and the camera captures the reflection on the user's face, proving they are a live person in front of a live screen. This is a lightweight, AI-free, and highly effective liveness verification method.

* **üåç Impossible Travel & Velocity Checks:** The backend flags applications by checking for multiple submissions from the same IP address or device fingerprint in a short time frame, a common tactic used by fraudsters.

* **üîê Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access:** Separate, secure login portals for Applicants and Loan Officers, powered by Supabase Auth.

* **üë®‚Äçüíº Officer Review Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard for loan officers to view the applicant queue, sorted by risk. Officers can drill down into any application to see the full data, the AI-generated risk score, and the liveness verification photos side-by-side.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project is built with a modern, decoupled architecture.

#### Technologies Used:
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Joblib
* **Deployment Concept**: The frontend can be served statically. The Flask backend is a separate service that exposes a REST API.

#### Architecture Diagram:
The user's application data is sent to a Flask API, which runs the ML model and communicates with Supabase to store and retrieve data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the EduShield project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Aadya402/EduShield.git](https://github.com/Aadya402/EduShield.git)
cd EduShield

---
### Step 2: Configure and Run the Backend (Flask)

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Folder**:
    Open a terminal and navigate to the `flask-backend` directory.
    ```bash
    cd flask-backend
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    This creates an isolated environment for your Python packages.
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
    This command installs all the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create `.env` File**:
    In the `flask-backend` folder, create a new file named `.env` and add your Supabase credentials. **Important**: Use the secret **`service_role`** key here, not the public `anon` key.
    ```env
    SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    SUPABASE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY"
    ```

5.  **Run the Flask Server**:
    With your virtual environment still active, run the following command to start the backend server.
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
